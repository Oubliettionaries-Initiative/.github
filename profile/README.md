# Oubliettionaries Initiative

## This initiative's purpose.
I (Jcc10) have always been interested in what it would take to bootstrap/rebuild a recognizably modern society if dropped off in the middle of nowhere. (ISOT / Isakai / TEOTWAWKI type scenarios) This project is intended to gather different resources together for ease of access & replication. Everything from wiki archival to various survival guides, chemistry and engineering to hardware recommendations and tech-tree guides.

Obviously this project would be best to be replicated locally for access in said scenarios.

Honestly, this is mostly just a giant thought experiment intended for educational purposes only.

### Initiative limitations
The following situations are outside the scope of the project:

* [Revelouti/on scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_(TV_series)). (Permanent loss of electrical mechanics.)
* Reincarnation Isakai. (The Initiative is designed around a physical repository.)

## Projects

Each Project is intended for a specific resource and/or source.
Projects listed as TBC have yet to be created.

Note: all projects are designed around a gnu/linux core system with stty/tty/telnet/ssh (with ssh/telnet/tty/stty being preferred)

### Meta. (Info, Research, Projections, & Hypotheticals)
These projects are intended for information generated for the initiative itself such as theoretical scenarios and what would be the best supply's to bootstrap them if you can bring anything.

### Collection Lists
These are lists of data that are considered essential for various reasons.

#### Essential Compilation Group (TBC)
Software required to compile other software from source-code. Sub-lists based on languages. Essential lists include all software to compile all OS packages from scratch.

#### OS Essentials (TBC)
All packages for a given OS to be usable to a point where all other packages can be installed from the mirror.

#### Local-Net-Backbone (TBC)
All packages to setup a system as a network backbone. (DNS, DCHP, Etc.)

#### Comms Backbone (TBC)
All packages for a system to function as a comms backbone. (Asterisk, SMTP, IRC, PKI, Etc.)

#### Mesh Essentials (TBC)
Software for mesh networking between sites as well as Async communications for dealing with intermittent data-links and sneaker-net data-links.

#### Format Path (TBC)
A series of documents containing any/all information for decoding various formats from near-first-principals.

### Mirror Software (sw-mirror)
These are projects designed to mirror pre-existing data-sources (Wiki dumps, Programming Language Docs, Package Repo's, etc) and store them in a organized manner.

Each project should also include easy ways to ensure copy's are kept up-to-date and ways to verify local-copy's are valid.

#### Wiki (TBC)
For mirroring and accessing wiki dumps from all(?) wiki platforms.

#### Docs (TBC)
For Programming Language, Encoding, and Codec documentation and RFC's.

#### Stack-Overflow (TBC)
For Stack-Overflow type data.

#### OS/Package Repo's (TBC)
Both for Package Repo's and copies of OS's. (Including Man pages)
Note: These are accessed using a plain HTTP mirror, as such there is no provided sw-access equivalent.

#### Git (TBC)
For mirroring Git Repo's.  
Note(?): These are accessed via ssh interfaces, as such there is no provided sw-access equivalent at this time.

#### AV (TBC)
For mirroring various types of books, audio, and video media.  
Note: This one may be split into various different source mirror sub-projects.

#### Maps (TBC)
For mirroring Map data. (OSM, USGS, Etc.)

### Access Software (sw-access)
This software is designed for accessing and indexing the above sources as well as custom sources.

#### Wiki (TBC)
For accessing all wiki data.

#### Docs (TBC)
For accessing all Doc formatted data.

#### Stack-Overflow (TBC)
For accessing all stack-overflow formatted data.

#### Media Library (TBC)
For accessing the media library. Limited use due to 

### Homebrew Interface Software (sw-custom)
These are projects for creating simplified interfaces for various projects.

#### Terminal interfaces (TBC)
For connecting dumb TTY terminals to the mainframe.

#### Secure teletypewriter (STTY) (TBC)
A overlay for TTY allowing for encryption of TTY using .

#### TTY Images (TBC)
A overlay for TTY allowing for binary image transfers to dumb TTY terminals.

#### Sneaker-Net Transfer Protocol (TBC)
A system (likely to be based on or around scuttlebutt) for allowing connection of systems via sneakernet.

### PnP Hardware (hw-modular)
This is for hardware that is built from both pre-existing hardware modules and homebrew modules that are simply connected together.

#### Archive Mainframe (TBC)
The archive mainframe is designed to provide the central data access for the project.

#### Power Generation Guide (TBC)
A guide for building & expanding various power-generation systems from parts & scrap.

#### RF Comms Guide (TBC)
A guide for various RF Comm systems. (From Ham Radio to LoRa systems) Including repeater systems.

### Homebrew Hardware (hw-custom)
These are projects for homebrew hardware and any accompanying firmware. (Dumb-terminals to connect to a mainframe for example.)

#### Dumb-Slate (TBC)
Dumb-Slates are designed as a cheap terminal for accessing a centralized data-system.

#### Isolated UPC Module (TBC)
A UPC module designed to only allow power to charge it or discharge it at a time, hardening a system to EMP's.

#### Homebrew Optical Data-Link (TBC)
A homebrew (& hopefully cheap) way to provide a data-link via optical signals. Both via fiber cables and free-air. (And repeaters for said systems.)

#### Homebrew Audio Data-Link (TBC)
A homebrew (& hopefully cheap) way to provide a data-link using audio signals.  
This should also include a sub-project for beam-formed audio projection. (And repeaters for said system.)

#### Oubliettionaries Pendant / Pendant Archive (TBC)
A pendant designed to be worn 24/7 containing a personal copy of the Oubliettionaries archive, the system is intended to store data with another unknown system acting as a interface.

### Hardware Research (hw-research)
Research for hardware endurance outside of the tolerance typically used. (EG: Testing equipment against EMP's or testing how many reads can be done to a storage medium before it fails)

#### SD Read Testing (TBC)
Testing different SD Card read cycles before failure.

#### EMP Testing (TBC)
Testing hardware and hardware enclosures against artificial EMP's.

#### Long-distance EMP Resistant Data-Links (TBC)
Testing solutions for long-distance data-links that are EMP resistant in a variety of situations (Fog, Rain, Snow, Hail, Thunderstorms, High-Wind, Etc.)  
For Optics the solution will likely be telescopes aligned with one another, for Audio it will likely be Beam-Formed Audio.
