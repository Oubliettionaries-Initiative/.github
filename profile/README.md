# Oubliettionaries Initiative

## Name Origin
The Oubliettionaries are a group of ships from Iain M. Banks's series of books called "The Culture", they are a contingency so that if The Culture is destroyed they can re-seed the galaxy (or potentially another one) with something that would be recognizably "Culture".

## This initiative's purpose.
I (Jcc10) have always been interested in what it would take to rebuild society if dropped off in the middle of nowhere. (ISOT / Isakai / EOTWAWKI type scenarios) This project is intended to gather different resources together for ease of access & replication. Everything from wiki archival to various survival guides, chemistry and engineering to hardware recommendations and tech-tree guides.

Obviously this project would be best to be replicated locally for access in said scenarios.

Honestly, this is mostly just a giant thought experiment intended for educational purposes only.

### Initiative limitations
The following situations are outside the scope of the project:

* [Revelouti/on scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_(TV_series)). (Permanent loss of electrical mechanics.)
