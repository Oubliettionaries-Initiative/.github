## ISOT / Island in a Sea Of Time - type scenario
This scenario involves a larger group of people (anywhere from a ship to a country) being transferred to another time or universe.

## Isakai - type scenario
This scenario involves a person being transferred to another time or universe with whatever was on them at the time. (Reincarnation is not included due to feasibility limitations.)

## TEOTWAWKI / The End of the World as We Know It - type scenario
This does not involve any physical displacement but is instead anything from a solar flare EMP or a Zombie outbreak to a flat out OCP. It involves any region all the way up to a global failure of society.   

## OCP / Outside Context Problem
> An Outside Context Problem was the sort of thing most civilisations encountered just once, and which they tended to encounter rather in the same way a sentence encountered a full stop. -- Iain M. Banks

An outside context problem is a large scale problem that is beyond the imagination of a society, organization or individual before it suddenly happens. The classic example is an isolated island with primitive technology that suddenly encounters a more advanced civilization.

## Oubliettionaries
The Oubliettionaries are a group of ships from Iain M. Banks' series of books called "The Culture", they are a contingency so that if The Culture is destroyed they can re-seed the galaxy (or potentially another one) with something that would be recognizably "Culture".
